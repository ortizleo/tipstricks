<Virtualhost *:80> with ServerName foo.com means "on all IPs managed on this host", "on port 80", "if the request host header is foo.com" I'll use this virtualhost
<Virtualhost *:*> with Servername foo.com means "on all IPs managed on this host", "on all ports", "if the request host header is foo.com" I'll use this virtualhost
<Virtualhost 10.0.0.2:*> with Servername foo.com means "for request incoming from my network interface 10.0.0.2", "on all ports", "if the request host header is foo.com" I'll use this virtualhost
<Virtualhost _default_:*> with Servername foo.com : should not be used with name based virtualhosting
And on an IP based Virtualhosting:

<Virtualhost 10.0.0.2:*> means "I'll use this virtualhost for request coming on my 10.0.0.2 interface"
<Virtualhost _default_:443> means "I'll use this virtualhost for all other network interface on my host for request coming on port 443"
<Virtualhost _default_:*> means "I'll use this virtualhost for all other network interface on my host, if it is not matched by a previous rule, and if the request host header is not matched by a named based virtualhost"
